The COVID Tracking Project collects information from 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and 5 other US territories to provide the most comprehensive testing data for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The dataset includes positive and negative results, pending tests, and total people tested for each state or district currently reporting that data.
