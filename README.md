# Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) US Testing Data | The COVID Tracking Project

You can subscribe to the AWS Data Exchange product utilizing the automation featured in this repository by visiting [https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-a2ev4blctqkwc](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-a2ev4blctqkwc). 

# Product Description
The COVID Tracking Project collects information from 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and 5 other US territories to provide the most comprehensive testing data for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The dataset includes positive and negative results, pending tests, and total people tested for each state or district currently reporting that data.

The data is collected from state/district/territory public health authorities or, occasionally, from trusted news reporting, official press conferences, or (very occasionally) tweets or Facebook updates from state public health authorities or governors.

#### Data Sources
All datasets are in both CSV and JSON format:
- States current testing data (`states_current`)
- States historical testing data (`states_daily`)
- States specific resources (`states_info`)
- US current testing data (`us_current`)
- US historical testing data (`us_daily`)
- COVID-19 related info from counties (`counties`)
- Track URLs for regional specific data (`url`)
- State website screenshots (`states_screenshots`)
- COVID Track Project press (`press`)
